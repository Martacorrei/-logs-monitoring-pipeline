# -logs-monitoring-pipeline
This repository contains the source code for the automated pipeline used to extract, parse, transform and store backend log data from an automated document software. The solution is built using Python scripts orchestrated via Apache Airflow and stores the resulting structured data in a PostgreSQL database for analysis and dashboard integration.
